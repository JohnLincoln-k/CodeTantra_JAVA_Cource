Java can be used to develop virtually any kind of software applications like Games that can run on PCs and Mobiles, Desktop Applications, Web Applications, Embedded Applications (for example applications which can run in a watch or a pen) etc.

We need JDK (Java Development Kit) to develop applications using Java.

JDK contains a crucial tool known as the compiler. It first changes the source code in a .java file into a special code called bytecode, by creating a .class file. After that, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets this bytecode and generates the output. The process of converting a .java file to a .class file is known as compilation.

JRE (JRE) contains all the required tools and libraries to execute the compiled Java code.

Java became quickly popular because the code written in Java can be run on any operating system (Like, Windows, Linux or Mac) provided it has the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on it.

Note: Code written in Java is compiled using the Java compiler which is bundled as part of JDK (Java Development Kit).
